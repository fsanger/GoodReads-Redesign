# GoodReads-Redesign

Redesign of the GoodReads website.

Using interviews and user stories, and SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats), the project goal was to reassess the priorities of the website as it currently stands and restructure the site in a more user friendly manner. Issues at hand included an overabundance of features and sections (often hidden), a lack of visual hierarchy, and a bland, monochromatic palette. 

Upon completion of the initial research and analysis, element collages and full comps were created in Illustrator. Consistency in regards to typography, button/icon implementation, color palette, and grid hierarchy were integral to the success of the project. Iteration of approaches to layout and organization of information evolved the project into a more user-friendly site. The finished site design was the subject of a web-based style guide.
